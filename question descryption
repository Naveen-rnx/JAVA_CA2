Q1.You are given a number of test cases. For each test case, you are given an integer N.

If N is even, print:
"HELLO KIET"

If N is odd, print:
"HI KIET"
Input Format

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶
Output Format

Output Format:
For each test case, print the corresponding greeting (HELLO KIET or HI KIET) in a new line.
Sample Input 0

4
Sample Output 0

HELLO KIET

Solution:
code --> import java.io.*; 
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("HELLO KIET");
        } else {
            System.out.println("HI KIET");
        }
        
        sc.close();
    }
}



Q2. A Java abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. That means you cannot create new instances of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses. You should learn about Java Inheritance before attempting this challenge.

Following is an example of abstract class:

abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
If you try to create an instance of this class like the following line you will get an error:

Book new_novel=new Book(); 
You have to create another class that extends the abstract class. Then you can create an instance of the new class.

Notice that setTitle method is abstract too and has no body. That means you must implement the body of that method in the child class.

In the editor, we have provided the abstract Book class and a Main class. In the Main class, we created an instance of a class called MyBook. Your task is to write just the MyBook class.

Your class mustn't be public.

Sample Input

A tale of two cities
Sample Output

The title is: A tale of two cities

Solution:

code -->  import java.util.*;
abstract class Book{
	String title;
	abstract void setTitle(String s);
	String getTitle(){
		return title;
	}
}
class MyBook extends Book {
    void setTitle(String s) {
        title = s;
    }
}
public class Main{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		//Book new_novel=new Book(); This line prHMain.java:25: error: Book is abstract; cannot be instantiated
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String title=sc.nextLine();
		MyBook new_novel=new MyBook();
		new_novel.setTitle(title);
		System.out.println("The title is: "+new_novel.getTitle());
      	sc.close();
		
	}
}



Q3.Write the following code in your editor below:

A class named Arithmetic with a method named add that takes 2 integers as parameters and returns an integer denoting their sum.
A class named Adder that inherits from a superclass named Arithmetic.
Your classes should not be be public.

Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin; a locked code stub will test your submission by calling the add method on an Adder object and passing it 2 integer parameters.

Output Format

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Your add method must return the sum of its parameters.

Sample Output

The main method in the Solution class above should print the following:

My superclass is: Arithmetic
42 13 20

Solution:

code --> import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;
class Arithmetic {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Adder extends Arithmetic {
}
public class Solution{
    public static void main(String []args){
        // Create a new Adder object
        Adder a = new Adder();
        
        // Print the name of the superclass on a new line
        System.out.println("My superclass is: " + a.getClass().getSuperclass().getName());	
        
        // Print the result of 3 calls to Adder's `add(int,int)` method as 3 space-separated integers:
        System.out.print(a.add(10,32) + " " + a.add(10,3) + " " + a.add(10,10) + "\n");
     }
}
